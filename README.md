# HW4-Quiz-App

Features:

I have created a quiz application
You are initially presented with a start screen to begin the quiz or to select and see the most recent high score
After you click start you are then taken to the quiz where a 30 second timer begins to countdown
You have 30 seconds to answer 5 questions
The questions are drawn at random so that you will not get the same order of questions each time
When a correct answer is clicked the choice will turn green and you will be rewarded 10 points
When you click the incorrect answer the choice turns red and you will be deducted 5 seconds from your countdown
Upon completion of the quiz or the expiration of the countdown the quiz is ended
You will then be prompted with an alert screen to put in your intials
After you have placed your intials and select "ok" you are then taken to the end screen where your intials and score are displayed
Beneath the display is a button called "play again"
After clicking this you will reset the quiz and quiz clock to begin another quiz
